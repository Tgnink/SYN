it's a GUI script , you need prepare one image overlap with roi as template

provide 4 functions:
1. drift roi position , you will get a roi zip file
2. align two image , you will get a new image with max merge percent to template image. And if template has rois, will get new roi zip file
3. expand roi area
4. template to find new rois ( doesn't work)
